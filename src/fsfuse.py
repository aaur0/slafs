#! /usr/bin/env python

# the above line is written for three reason
# 1. to specify that the file is to be interperted. The character "#!" a.k.a shebang is an indication to the shell that the file is a script and has to be interpreted
# 2. the next part is to invoke the interpreter and also specify the interpretor type. Interpreter is invoked using the "env" command which resides in the /usr/bin/ directory.
#    this command spawn a new process of type python which would do the interpretation of the file.
